// ❓ DESCRIPTION:
// In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?
// ❗ NOTES:
// The number can be negative already, in which case no change is required.
// Zero (0) is not checked for any specific sign. Negative zeros make no mathematical sense.

// ✅ SOLUTION:
function makeNegative(num) {
    return num > 0 ? -num : num
};

console.log('negative number: ' + makeNegative(8));
